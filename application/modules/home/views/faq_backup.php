								<h4>When will the PMAY subsidy reach me?</h4>

								<p>Once the PMAY home loan application is approved, the bank will credit the subsidy to the loan account of the borrower, in advance, which will reduce The principal amount borrowed.

So the loan amount will be reduced to 3.33 (6 Lakhs -2.67 Lakhs=3.33 lakhs) and EMIs will be paid on this new amount.
